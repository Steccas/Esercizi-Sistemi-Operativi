## Esercizi laboratorio di Sistemi Operativi

Questi sono i miei esercizi relativi al laboratorio del corso di Sistemi Operativi (A.A. 2014/2015) tenuto dal Professore Mario Di Raimondo (Università degli Studi di Catania).
Usali pure come esempio :)

Those are some excercises written in C when I was studying for a university course called Operating Systems (Professor Mario Di Raimondo) during Academic Year 2014/2015 at University of Studies of Catania.
